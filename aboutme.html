					<h1>A leap of faith</h1>
					<p>At the height of Covid, I dropped out of nursing school to become an Engineer.</br>

				<p></p>
				<p>Despite being a high achiever in highschool, I found myself in a slump while pursuing a degree in
					nursing. At that point, I had completed two placements but struggled to imagine myself striving in a
					hospital setting. I knew that I needed a change of environment but I was at a loss.</p>

				<p>Prior to pursuing nursing, I bought my first car and I spent so much time going down the rabbit hole
					of finding the best car for my budget. Over time, I grew a massive passion for the automotive scene.
					I spent countless weekends modifying it to suit my style. One day, it just dawned on me that I loved
					design and tinkering with things so I took a leap of faith.</p>

				<p>Today, Iâ€™m a final year mechanical and mechatronics student at the University of Technology Sydney. I
					have consistently demonstrated exceptional academic achievement, maintaining a High-Distinction WAM
					and earning a place on the Engineering Dean's List for outstanding performance in both 2022 and
					2023.</p>

				<p>Overall, my academic achievements, technical expertise, and practical experience have equipped me
					with a diverse skill set and a strong foundation in engineering. I am eager to apply my knowledge
					and contribute to innovative projects and teams that drive technological advancements.</p>

				<p>If you are seeking a dedicated and resourceful engineering professional with a proven track record of
					success, I would be delighted to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-nguyen-engineer/" target="_blank">connect</a> and explore potential opportunities.</p>
